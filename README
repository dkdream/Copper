Copper is a PEG (Parsing Expression Grammars) parser generator.
copper converts a peg grammer file (.cu) into a c-file containning an AST (Abstract Syntax Tree).

Copper's grammar is written in Copper and is parsed by the copper parsing engine.
this acts as an example of how to use Copper as well as the main unit test.

Highlights:
  Parsing Expression Grammar base
  Parsing engine is fed the data from the user code instead of using callback functions 
  No need for a separate lexer
  Grammars are composible (as long as the rule definition dont conflict)

Drawbacks:
  Does not support left-recursive grammars
  Non-Packrack parser
