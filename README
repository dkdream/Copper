Copper is a PEG parser generator.
copper converts a peg grammer file (.cu) into a c-file containning an AST.

Coppers grammer is written in Copper and is parsed by the copper parsing engine.
this acts as an example of how to use Copper as well as the main unit test.

Highlights:
  Parsing Expression Grammer base
  Parsing engine is event base and not the driver (like yacc)
  No need for a seperate lexer
  Grammers are composible so (as long as rule definition dont conflict)

Drawbacks:
  Dose not support left-recursive grammers
  Non-Packrack parser
